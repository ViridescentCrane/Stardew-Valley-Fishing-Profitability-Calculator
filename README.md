# Stardew-Valley-Fishing-Profitability-Calculator
A small program for Stardew Valley players that allows you to input your current season and weather and spits out the most profitable place to fish, based on the average price of all the fish available to catch in each location.

The fish information is taken from the "fishing Pole Fish" table on the Stardew Valley Wiki (https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Fish)
For the purposes of this program, I excluded the following fish from the program's calculations:
- The fish obtainable from the submarine ride at the night market, since those fish are only available for a very limited time.
- The Legendary and Legendary II fish, since those fish can only be caught once.
- Non-fish catchables (eg. green algae), since they don't sell for very much
- Creatures that are only caught in the crab pots

I also excluded the following factors from the program's calculations
- catch rates/fishing zone (the program assumes all fish are equally catchable)
- minigame difficulty (the program assumes you win every instance of the fishing minigame)
- the possibility of catching treasure (the program assumes no treasure is caught)
- trash percentages (the program assumes you will never catch trash)
- time of day (I actually hope to add this in soon)

There is also one known issue: the catfish is available in summer and fall but only in the secret woods swamp. The program currently does not take this into account and assumes the catfish can be caught in summer and fall in all the locations it appears. I hope to eventually patch this.

With all that in mind, though, hopefully this will help some of you to make more money fishing.

This program was written by me, ViridescentCrane, and my boyfriend, who wishes to remain anonymous. You are free to add onto, change, or otherwise use this program any way you wish. However I would appreciate it if you credited us or linked back to this GitHub page.

Happy fishing!
